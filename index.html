<br><strong>A masterful surgeon,</strong> he can perform dozensof flawlesscataractoperations<wbr> at eye camps over the course of a 12-hour day. Working <em>tirelessly</em> at the operating table, he says “the surgical chair is the most comfortable place on Earth that I have.”<br/>
<br>Sanduk Ruit was born in <i>Olangchungola,</i> a remote village in Eastern Nepal — so remote the nearest school was a week’s walk away. And there were no health posts.
